    <h3 style="text-align: right;">Gojo Satoru</h3>
    <p> Satoru Gojo (五ご条じょう悟さとる Gojō Satoru?) is one of the main protagonists of the 
        Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized 
        as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the Gojo Family, the first person 
        to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works as a 
        teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong 
        young allies.</p>
    <h3 style="text-align: right;"><i>Background</i></h3>
    <p style="color: red;"><u>Satoru is a very tall, lean and muscular man who is in his late
        twenties and is considered relatively attractive, mainly due to his facial features.</u> 
        He has snow-white hair and the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color. 
        Satoru normally covers his eyes with a black blindfold which props up his hair and 
        gives it a spikier appearance.<sub>When sporting a more casual look, Satoru will wear 
        sunglasses and let his hair down to reach the base of his neck.<sub></p>
